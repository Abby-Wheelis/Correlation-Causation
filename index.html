<h1>Correlation vs Causation</h1>

    <h3>What is correlation used for?</h3>
    
        <p>
            Correlation is used to portray a relationship between two different quantitative variables that is linear. Frequently correlation is discussed with regards to the correlation coefficient r, which is an indicator of the strength of a positive or negative linear relationship between two quantitative variables. The closer r is to -1, the stronger the negative relationship between the variables, the closer it is to 1, the stronger the positive relationship. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 0, the weaker the overall relationship between the variables. Additionally, correlation is a non-resistive statistic, meaning that it is very sensitive to outliers, which is something important to keep in mind. Sometimes, quantitative variables have a strong relationship that is not linear. In this case it is not useful to discuss correlation, as correlation only pertains to linear relationships.

    <h3>What is the difference between correlation and causation?</h3>
    
        <p>
            The difference between correlation and causation is that causation implies that one variable is causing the change in another variable. In other words, the explanatory variable (x) both causes and explains the changes in the response variable (y). For example, chocolate consumption and Nobel prize winners may be correlated, but it is unlikely that one causes the other. On the other hand, smoking and lung cancer are both correlated and have a causational relationship.

    <h3>Compare and contrast 3 different ways to visually show relationships.</h3>
        
        <ul>
            
            <li>Scatter Plot Matrix:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scatterplots for lots of variables in different combinations, essentially a big grid of scatterplots</li>
                    <li>Allows you to compare more than two variables</li>
                    <li>Can be visually busy and/or confusing</li>
                    <li>Creates an in-depth view of the big-picture relationshops between numerous variables</li>
            
                </ul>
        
            <li>Parallel Coordinate Planes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compares one variable to several others</li>
                    <li>Allows you to compare more than two variables</li>
                    <li>Requires careful examination to extract meaning</li>
                    <li>It is important to order the variables in such a way that important patterns are highlighted</li>
                    <li>Key to enable interactivity to highlight elements of interest</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Simplified version of a scatterplot which has a color scale based on the correlation coefficients</li>
                    <li>Allows you to compare more than two variables</li>
                    <li>Not appropriate when relationships are clearly not linear</li>
                    <li>Provides a simple summary of large data sets</li>
